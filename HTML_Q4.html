<!-- First a button item should be created.

<div><button></button></div>

Then you should add style to the css file just to make him prettier :).

.button:hover { background-color: #4CAF50; /* Green */ color: white; }

Next step is to center the button by both main axis and height.

.center-x { display: flex;/* or display:grid */ justify-content: center; }

.center-y { display: flex;align-items: center; }

.heightMidScreen { height: 500; } 

Final step, is to combine all the modifications into a css rule to implement on the class assigned
to the button. 

class="center-x center-y heightMidScreen" -->
